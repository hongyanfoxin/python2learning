"""
Itâ€™s important to be clear about the relationship between iterables and iterators: Python
obtains iterators from iterables.
The standard interface for an iterator has two methods:
__next__
    Returns the next available item, raising StopIteration when there are no more items.
__iter__
    Returns self; this allows iterators to be used where an iterable is expected, for example, in a for loop.
